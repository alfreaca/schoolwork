These are all the python solutions from the pseudocode solutions on the first worksheet
of the first module of Computer Science.

1) Use Google to find the formula for converting pounds to kilos and kilos to pounds. 
Write a pseudocode algorithm that prompts the user to enter a kilo value and a pound 
value. The program will then convert the kilos to pounds and the pounds to kilos. 
It will then output both values. 

2) Write a pseudocode algorithm that prompts the user to enter a three-digit number and 
outputs the hundreds, tens and units.

Example: 523 will output 5 hundreds, 2 tens and 3 units. Use what you learned about division.

3)When validating a new password on a website the programmer might use a string function to 
check the length. 
Write a pseudocode statement to do this, using an appropriate function.
